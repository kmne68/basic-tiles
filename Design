Basic Tiles

The purpose of this program is to provide a basic tile-based gaming environment.

The game loop in Game.java paints the map, player and other game objects including
monsters and loot.

Object types and locations are generated randomly.

Create the map:

for the width of the map
  for the length of the map
    if tile is blocked, change it to a random color
Create an array or list of objects to be added to the map
Create the algorithm that assigns objects to tiles

Determine object attributes:
Location (x, y coordinates)
Blocking (boolean)
Structure (type, size)
Vegetation
Geology
Mineralogy
Fauna





        for (int x = 0; x < MAP_WIDTH; x++) {
            for (int y = 0; y < MAP_HEIGHT; y++) {
                g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
                if(mapData[x][y] == BLOCKED) {
                    g.setColor(Color.red);
                }
